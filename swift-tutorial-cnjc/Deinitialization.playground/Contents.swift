/* ------------------------------------ Deinitialization ------------------------------------ */
/*
 A deinitializer is called immediately before a class instance is deallocated.
 You write deinitializers with the deinit keyword, similar to how initializers
 are written with the init keyword. Deinitializers are only available on class types.
 */

/* ------------------------------------ How Deinitialization Works ------------------------------------ */
/*
 Swift automatically deallocates your instances when they’re no longer needed, to free up resources.
 Swift handles the memory management of instances through automatic reference counting (ARC),
 as described in Automatic Reference Counting. Typically you don’t need to perform manual cleanup
 when your instances are deallocated. However, when you are working with your own resources,
 you might need to perform some additional cleanup yourself. For example,
 if you create a custom class to open a file and write some data to it,
 you might need to close the file before the class instance is deallocated.
